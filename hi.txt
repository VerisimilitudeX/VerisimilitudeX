Hi! The spring of the latch on the back that is used to fold the scooter broke after 3 weeks of using it on normal flat terrain. I haven't even used the latch to fold it before and now it makes a lot of noise when I drive the scooter. This is unacceptable quality for a $500. In fact, this is the second time that this has happened. The first scooter I purchased from this company broke down in 1 week and so I had to get it replaced by you guys.
