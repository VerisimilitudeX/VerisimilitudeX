<h2 align-"left">About Me</h2>

Hi, I'm Piyush Acharya, founder of DNAnalyzer, researcher at the University of Victoria, and President of Interlake Programming Club! My goal is to democratize access to DNA testing and make scientific analyses affordable and private.

I founded [DNAnalyzer](https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/DNAnalyzer), a GitHub #1 Trending platform that revolutionizes ML-powered DNA analysis and makes it accessible to all. I'm also the Head Organizer of [HackPNW](https://github.com/HackPNW) (Washington's largest high school hackathon), President of Interlake Programming Club, and an affiliated researcher at the [University of Victoria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hiBGZEAAAAJ&hl=en), where I apply machine learning techniques to knowledge graphs and epigenetics.

I love competing in coding and science tournaments, making fun and useful projects, and exploring new technologies. Some of my key achievements include winning the U.S. Department of Energy's [National Science Bowl Finals](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-winners-32nd-annual-national-science-bowl#:~:text=include%3A%20Vishnu%20Mangipudi%2C-,Piyush%20Acharya,-%2C%20) in Washington D.C., being a two-time winner of the U.S. House of Representatives [Congressional App Challenge](https://adamsmith.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-smith-announces-ninth-district-winners-2023-congressional-app-challenge#:~:text=Commuter%2C%20created%20by-,Piyush%20Acharya,-%2C%20), and being part of USACO Gold. In my spare time, you can find me exploring the latest in technology, biking through the extensive Redmond trail system, or flying my drone.
