<h2 align-"left">About Me</h2>

Hi, I'm Piyush Acharya, founder of DNAnalyzer, VP of Interlake Programming Club, and Organizer at HackPNW!

I'm a sophomore at Interlake High School and the founder of [DNAnalyzer](https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/DNAnalyzer), a platform that revolutionizes ML-powered DNA analysis and makes it accessible to all. I'm also an Organizer at [HackPNW](https://github.com/HackPNW) (Washington's largest student-led hackathon organization), Vice President of [Interlake Programming Club](https://www.interlakeprogrammingclub.com/), as well as a research assistant at Northeastern University working on consumer applications of <mark>neurological radiance fields</mark> (NeRFs).

I love competing in coding and science tournaments, making fun and useful projects, and exploring new technologies. Some of my achievements include winning the U.S. Department of Energy [National Science Bowl Finals](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-winners-32nd-annual-national-science-bowl#:~:text=include%3A%20Vishnu%20Mangipudi%2C-,Piyush%20Acharya,-%2C%20Aishwarya%20Agrawal%2C%20Aryan) in Washington D.C., two-time winner of the U.S. House of Representatives [Congressional App Challenge](https://adamsmith.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-smith-announces-ninth-district-winners-2023-congressional-app-challenge#:~:text=Commuter%2C%20created%20by-,Piyush%20Acharya,-%2C%20Nishant%20Vikramaditya%2C%20and), and placing 2nd in the 2024 Science Olympiad Robot Tour event. In my spare time, you can find me exploring the latest in technology, running cross country, or flying my DJI Mavic 3.

Feel free to check out my website or connect with me on LinkedIn or Dev.to!
